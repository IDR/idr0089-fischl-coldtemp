Study Description	Cooling patients to sub-physiological temperatures is an integral part of modern medicine. We show that cold exposure induces temperature-specific changes to the higher-order chromatin and gene expression profiles of human cells. These changes are particularly dramatic at 18°C, a temperature synonymous with that experienced by patients undergoing controlled deep-hypothermia during surgery. Cells exposed to 18°C exhibit largely nuclear-restricted transcriptome changes. These include the nuclear accumulation of core circadian clock suppressor gene transcripts, most notably REV-ERBα. This response is accompanied by compaction of higher-order chromatin and hindrance of mRNPs from engaging nuclear pores. Rewarming reverses chromatin compaction and releases the transcripts into the cytoplasm, triggering a pulse of suppressor gene proteins that resets the circadian clock. We show that cold-induced upregulation of REV-ERBα alone is sufficient to trigger this resetting. Our findings uncover principles of the cellular cold-response that must be considered for current and future applications involving therapeutic deep-hypothermia.

Protocol Description	3D-SIM slide preparation.  AC16 cells were cultured on 22x22 mm #1.5H high precision 170 μm ± 5 μm poly-L-lysine treated coverslips (Marienfeld Superior). After exposure to a particular temperature condition, culture media was aspirated, and coverslips were washed once with PBS. Cells were fixed by incubating for 10 min in 2% formaldehyde/PBS, then washed with 0.05 % Tween-20/PBS (PBST), permeabilized by incubating for 10 min in 0.2 % Triton-X-100/PBS, and then washed again with PBST. Coverslips were incubated (30 min, RT) in MaxBlock (ActiveMotif, cat#15252), then (overnight, 4°C) in MaxBlock containing primary antibodies against the proteins of interest (primary antibody details and dilutions are shown in Table S8), washed 4 times with PBST, then incubated (30 min, RT) in MaxBlock containing fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies (secondary antibody details and dilutions are shown in Table S8), washed again 4 times with PBST. Cells were post-fixed by incubating for 10 min in 4% formaldehyde/PBS and washed with PBST. Coverslips were incubated in PBST containing 2 μg/ml DAPI, washed with PBST, mounted in non-hardening Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, cat#H-1000) and stored at 4°C.	
3D-SIM image acquisition, reconstruction and quality control were carried out as detailed in Miron et al., 2019 (Miron et al, 2019). Images were acquired with a DeltaVision OMX V3 Blaze system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a 60x/1.42 NA PlanApo oil immersion objective (Olympus), pco.edge 5.5 sCMOS cameras (PCO) and 405, 488, 593 and 640 nm lasers. Spherical aberration was minimized using immersion oil with refractive index (RI) 1.514. 3D image stacks were acquired over the whole nuclear volume in z and with 15 raw images per plane (five phases, three angles). The raw data were computationally reconstructed with SoftWoRx 6.5.2 (GE Healthcare) using channel-specific OTFs recorded using immersion oil with RI 1.512, and Wiener filter settings between 0.002-0.006 to generate 3D stacks of 115 nm (488 nm) or 130 nm (593 nm) lateral and approximately 350 nm axial resolution. Multi-channel acquisitions were aligned in 3D using Chromagnon software (Matsuda et al, 2018) based on 3D-SIM acquisitions of multi-colour EdU-labelled C127 cells(Kraus et al, 2017). Table S9 details the number of nuclei imaged for each repeat, temperature condition and marker combination.
3D-SIM imaging and subsequent quantitative analyses are susceptible to artefacts (Demmerle et al, 2017). For instance, bulk labelling of densely packed chromatin inside mammalian nuclei of several μm depth entails high levels of out-of-focus blur, which reduces the contrast of illumination stripe modulation and thus the ability to recover high frequency (i.e., super- resolution) structure information. All SIM data were therefore routinely and meticulously quality controlled for effective resolution and absence of artifacts using SIMcheck (Ball et al, 2015), an open-source Image J plugin to assess SIM image quality via modulation contrast-to-noise ratio (MCNR), spherical aberration mismatch, reconstructed Fourier plot and reconstructed intensity histogram values (for more details see Demmerle et al., 2017 (Demmerle et al, 2017)).  To exclude potential false positive calls, we used the “MCNR map” macro of SIMcheck, which generates a metric of local stripe contrast in different regions of the raw data and directly correlates with the level of high-frequency information content in the reconstructed data (Demmerle et al, 2017). Only IF centroid signals with underlying MCNR values exceeding a stringent quality threshold were considered, while localisations with low underlying MCNR were discarded during the ChaiN analysis pipeline to exclude any SIM signal which falls below reconstruction confidence.

Protocol Description	RNA-FISH slide preparation.  Cells were cultured on poly-L-lysine treated coverslips. Culture media was aspirated, and coverslips were washed once with PBS. Cells were fixed by incubating for 10 min with 4 % formaldehyde/PBS, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized by incubating (>3 h, -20°C) in 70 % ethanol. Cells were rehydrated by incubating (5 min, RT) with FISH wash buffer (10 % formamide, 2x SSC). For hybridization, coverslips were placed cell-coated side down on a 48μl drop containing 100 nM Quasar570-labelled probes complementary to one of REV-ERBα, CRY2, or TP53 transcripts (Biosearch Technologies) (see Table S6 for probe sequences), 0.1 g/ml dextran sulfate, 1 mg/ml E. coli tRNA, 2 mM VRC, 20 μg/ml BSA, 2x SSC, 10 % formamide and incubated (37°C, 20 h) in a sealed parafilm chamber. Coverslips were twice incubated (37°C, 30 min) in pre-warmed FISH wash buffer, then in PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (5 min, RT), washed twice with PBS, dipped in water, air-dried, placed cell-coated side down on a drop of ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (Life Technologies), allowed to polymerize for 24 h in the dark and then sealed with nail varnish.	
RNA-FISH image acquisition and analysis.  Cells were imaged using a DeltaVision Elite wide-field fluorescence deconvolution microscope using a 60x/1.40 objective lens (Olympus) and immersion oil with refractive index 1.514. First, the Quasar570-labelled RNA FISH probes were imaged using the TRITC channel, followed by imaging of the DAPI channel. The number of 0.2 μm-separated stacks imaged, number of replicates imaged for each condition and number of images across all combined replicates are listed in Table S7 (column “Stacks”, “Reps” and “Total images”, respectively). Images were deconvolved using the default conservative deconvolution method using DeltaVision Softworx software. Image quantification was carried out using Fiji (Schindelin et al, 2012). Deconvolved images were compressed to 2D images displaying the maximum intensity projection for each pixel across z-stacks listed in Table S7 (column “Projected”). Cell and nuclear areas were outlined using thresholding functions on the background TRITC signal and DAPI signal, respectively. Dots corresponding to transcripts were then counted for both nuclear and cytoplasmic areas for each image by applying the “Find Maxima” command with a noise tolerance specified in Table S7 (column “Maxima”). Bar charts show the mean number of dots per nuclear area and cytoplasmic area across all images for all combined replicates.
